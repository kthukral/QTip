QTip

This is a prototype application for iPhone called Qtip or Quality Tipper. The application is a simple tipper application
which requires the bill amount and number of people as input and instead of you providing a tip percentage, you rate your experience
using 3 sliders, Ambiance, Service and Food. The tip percentage is decided on the rating you provide on the given sliders.

The application contains two views, the main view and the settings view, which can be accessed by pressing the small
i (info) button in the bottom right corner. The application utilizes a flip view controller to go between the two views.
The settings view has a switch, the state of which determines if the final amount is rounded up or not. The state of the switch is
saved on the device so that you do not have to change it multiple times.

The app contains no calculate button as the final amounts are recalculated every time you make a change in the application.
